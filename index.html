    <div id="cloudTheory">
    <p id="cloudComputingPoint1"><ul><li>The term cloud refers to a network or the internet. It is a technology that uses remote servers on the internet to store, manage, and access data online rather than local drives. The data can be anything such as files, images, documents, audio, video, and moreCloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, etc.</li></ul></p>

      <p id="cloudComputingPoint2">
        <ul><li>Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.</li></ul>
      </p>

      <p id="cloudComputingPoint3">
        <ul><li>In todays times, cloud computing is gaining more and more popularity for many reasons such as flexibity, affordability, effectiveness, scalability , reliability and much more. Cloud computing makes it easier for companies to manage and process without having to do majority of the work themselves. It is best for both new startups and aldready established companies. </li></ul>

      <dl id="typesOfCloudList"><dh class="firstTypeOfCloud">1.Public Cloud</dh><dd class="firstTypeOfCloud">Public clouds are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service providers, which deliver their computing resources, like servers and storage, over the Internet. Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud. With a public cloud, all hardware, software, and other supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider. You access these services and manage your account using a web browser.</dd>
      
      <dh class="secondTypeOfCloud">2.Private Cloud</dh><dd class="secondTypeOfCloud">A private cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located on the company’s on-site datacenter. Some companies also pay third-party service providers to host their private cloud. A private cloud is one in which the services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network.</dd>
        
      <dh class="thirdTypeOfCloud">3.Hybrid Cloud</dh><dd class="thirdTypeOfCloud">Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them. By allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds, a hybrid cloud gives your business greater flexibility, more deployment options, and helps optimize your existing infrastructure, security, and compliance. </dd></dl>

      <h2><u>Cloud Deployment Models</u></h2>
      <dl id="cloudDeploymentModelsList">
        <dh><u>1.Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</u></dh><dd>The most basic category of cloud computing services. With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.</dd>
        
        <dh><u>2.Platform as a service (PaaS)</u></dh><dd>Platform as a service refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network, and databases needed for development.</dd>
        
        <dh><u>3.Serverless computing</u></dh><dd>Overlapping with PaaS, serverless computing focuses on building app functionality without spending time continually managing the servers and infrastructure required to do so. The cloud provider handles the setup, capacity planning, and server management for you. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.</dd>
        
        <dh><u>4.Software as a service (SaaS)</u></dh><dd>Software as a service is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure, and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. Users connect to the application over the Internet, usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet, or PC.</dd>
